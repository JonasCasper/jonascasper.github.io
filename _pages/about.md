**Hi!**

I am an Economics PhD Student at [LMU Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/) with a research interest in trade, spatial, and environmental economics. **I am on the 2025/26 academic job market.**

You can find my CV [here](https://jonascasper.github.io/files/CV_JC.pdf).

I am fascinated by why economic integration, despite being a powerful force for aggregate growth, often produces divergent outcomes and unevenly distributed effects. I trace the source of this divergence to the micro-foundations of firm behavior in response to falling trade costs, both international and domestic. 

In my Job Market Paper, I examine "only-exporters", firms that almost exclusivley export instead of serving the domestic market. Across countries they make up a fifth of all exporters, and as much as a third in developing countries. They are also the least productive firms. Why do they exist? And what do they imply for the aggregate effects of trade liberalization?
