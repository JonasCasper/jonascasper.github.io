**Hi!**

I am an Economics PhD Student at [LMU Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/) with a research interest in trade, spatial, and environmental economics. **I am be on the 2025/26 academic job market.**

You can find my CV [here](https://jonascasper.github.io/files/CV_JC.pdf).

I am fascinated by why economic integration, despite being a powerful force for aggregate growth, often produces divergent outcomes and unevenly distributed effects. I trace the source of this divergence to the micro-foundations of firm behavior in response to falling trade costs, both international and domestic. 
In my Job Market Paper, I examine "only-exporters", firms that sell almost exclusively abroad and are systematically less productive than firms serving the domestic market. These firms are highly prevalent, comprising approximately one-fifth of all exporters globally and a third in developing countries. The paper rationalises these firms through an "exporting to escape" mechanism, where low domestic incomes and intense domestic competition pushes the least productive firms to serve richer, less competitive foreign markets. When only-exporters are present, trade integration will reallocate market share toward this least productive segment, thereby muting or even reversing the expected aggregate productivity gains from trade.
